## About myself

>I am 25. In November 2021, I began to learn programming, starting with HTML and CSS. In March of this year, I got acquainted with GIT and JS, which I still study and practice. Before I started learning programming, I worked for 3.5 years as a postal specialist at the post office. This work helped me to acquire such qualities as: sociability, stress resistance, learning ability, perseverance, responsibility, etc. These skills helped me in learning how to program and will help me become a good front-end developer.
